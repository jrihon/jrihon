Hi there, a PhD student over at the lab of Medicinal Chemistry @Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven. 
Contracted by the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven).\
I've studied Pharmaceutical Sciences, with a master degree in Drug Design and Development, and decided to completely switch it up and go towards the computational sciences. I've quite quickly grown fond of exploring and exploiting research methods through computational methods, during my master thesis, that I was very intent on continuing research in this field. I work primarily through numerical programming, scripting methods and predict biochemical reality through computational experiments.

## Research
My main focus is on the computational characterisation of nucleic acids and protein engineering\
 `comp chem` `comp bio` `bio informatics`\
 `chemistry` `biology` `biotechnology`

I work through static and dynamic modeling approaches, with the intent on making biological systems suitable by predicting the viability of said systems.

## Skills

`python 3`\
`shell scripting`\
`Vi Improved (Vim)`\
`.dotfile configuration`

## .dotfile
The available .dotfiles are to be used in conjuction.\
The Vim plugin manager I use is the `vim-plug`, over at [junegunn/vim-plug](github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)\
The `Starship` prompt is available over at [Starship](https://starship.rs/)

Make sure you have a github account and a valid .gitconfig file with at least your username and email configured, in order to download automatically from the available repositories.
