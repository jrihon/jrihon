# Jrihon

Software engineer over at BioLizard (Ghent, Belgium).

Did my PhD (Medicinal Chemistry, KU Leuven, Rega Institute) on the topic of synthetic nucleic acids, using computational chemistry and cheminformatics.
I developed forcefields and modelled bespoke xenobiotic nucleic acids, which was facilitated by the Ducque (model builder) and pucke.rs (conformational sampling) tools I created during my research projects.

Feel free to reach out to me on my research and future endeavours!

## Programming

### Languages
`Python` | `Rust` | `Bash` | `Typst` | `LaTeX` | `Lua` | `Julia` | `Nextflow`

Brief encounters with `C` | `Pascal`
### Check out my projects ! 
- [jrihon/Ducque](https://github.com/jrihon/Ducque) - A model builder to generate models of XNA, with user-implementable analogs, in Python!
- [jrihon/puckepy](https://github.com/jrihon/puckepy) - Python module for QM-based conformational sampling of molecules - written in Rust btw.
- [jrihon/puckers](https://github.com/jrihon/puckers) - Rust CLI for QM-based conformational sampling of molecules.
- [jrihon/mutineer.lua](https://github.com/jrihon/mutineer.lua) - Extensible commenting plugin for nvim, in Lua.
- [jrihon/multi-bibs](https://github.com/jrihon/multi-bibs) -  Support multiple bibliographies e.g. for thesis manuscripts, in Typst.


### .dotfiles (links to configs)

I use the [kitty](https://github.com/jrihon/kitty) terminal emulator and have my prompts customised through [starship](https://github.com/jrihon/starship). 
To work and manage projects, I use [tmux](https://github.com/jrihon/tmux). All my programming and general text editing is done with [neovim](https://github.com/jrihon/nvim).

## PhD research
- Modeling the behaviour of synthetic analogs of DNA and RNA `(XNA)`.
- Perform predictions using pure in silico methodologies.
- Use computational chemistry to describe the modified analogs `(QM` |`force field design` | `MM)`.
- Developed cheminformatics tools to design a pipeline for model prediction `(programming)`.

`SPOILER ALERT --- GREAT SUCCESS !`
