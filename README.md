Hi there, a PhD student over at the lab of Medicinal Chemistry @Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven. 
Contracted by the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven).\
I've studied Pharmaceutical Sciences, with a master degree in Drug Design and Development, and decided to completely switch it up and go towards the computational sciences.

# Research
My main focus is on the computational characterisation of nucleic acids `comp chem` `comp bio` `bio informatics`.\
I work through static and dynamic modeling approaches, with the intent on making biological systems suitable by predicting the viability of said systems.\
